Subject: [PATCH 8/8] window-actor: Special-case shaped Java windows

OpenJDK wrongly assumes that shaping a window implies no shadows.
They got lucky until commit b975676c changed the fallback case,
but now their compliance tests are broken. Make them happy again
by special-casing shaped Java windows.
